pluralized_models
=================

Automatic pluralized AR models generation. For instance, if you have

  class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  end

you'll automatically get Posts object proxy that will call singular class methods:

  Posts.find(:all)
  Posts.all
  Posts.find_by_title
  Posts.scoped_by_date

are now available automatically.

Also,

  Posts.new
  
will create a new instance of Post.

Meant to be not destructive to existent classes/modules.

INSTALLATION
============

  script/plugin install git://github.com/yaroslav/pluralized_models.git

from your Rails application directory.
